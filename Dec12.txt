Design Thinking:
Design thinking first and foremost involves empathizing with the problem. We must properly understand a problem before we start providing solutions. First of all, when we have a certain problem or issue, the first thing we must do is elaborate the problem properly. After elaborating the problem, we must think of ways to solve the problem. This is called ideation. Ideation must involve a lot of critical thinking as well as out of the box solutions to the particular problem. The step after ideation is the building of a prototype. A prototype is the miniaturized version of the possible solutions obtained through ideation. When a prototype fails, we start again with the ideation and come up with other solutions. Once a prototype is successfully in place, we build the solution on a larger scale. After this we do testing to see if the given solution is viable. If it is not a viable solution. If the solution is viable, we refine the solution. By refining, we mean perfecting the solution and getting it ready for deployment.
